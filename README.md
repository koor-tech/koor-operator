# koor-operator
An operator that installs Koor Storage Distro

## Description
This operator is equivalent to the following commands:

```sh
helm repo add koor-release https://charts.koor.tech/release
helm install --create-namespace --namespace <namespace> <namespace>-rook-ceph koor-release/rook-ceph -f utils/operatorValues.yaml
helm install --create-namespace --namespace <namespace> <namespace>-rook-ceph-cluster \
    --set operatorNamespace=<namespace> koor-release/rook-ceph-cluster -f utils/clusterValues.yaml
```

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) to get a local cluster for testing or run against a remote cluster.

**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e., whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Use a Local Docker Registry with Minikube
1. Make sure you start minikube with `--insecure-registry="localhost:5000"`. You might need to delete and restart minikube.

2. Enable the minikube [registry plugin](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/registry/#docker-on-macos):

```sh
minikube addons enable registry
```

3. Redirect port 5000 on docker to port 5000 on the minikube

```sh
sudo docker run -d --network=host alpine/socat TCP-LISTEN:5000,reuseaddr,fork TCP:$(minikube ip):5000
```

1. Set the registry as `localhost:5000`

```sh
export REGISTRY_HOST=localhost:5000
```

## Run the operator
There are four ways to run the operator:

1. As a Go program outside a cluster
2. As a Deployment inside a Kubernetes cluster
3. Managed by the [Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/olm-integration/tutorial-bundle/#enabling-olm) in [bundle](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/olm-integration/quickstart-bundle/) format
4. Using [helm](https://helm.sh/)

### Run locally outside the cluster
1. Generate certificates for local testing:

```sh
make local-certs
```

2. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

3. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make local-certs install run`

#### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Running as a Deployment inside the cluster
1. Build and push your image to the registry. If `IMG` is not specified, it defaults to `$(REGISTRY_HOST)/koor-operator:v$(VERSION)`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push
```

2. Install `cert-manager` if not already installed:

```sh
make cert-manager
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy
```

#### Undeploy controller
To undeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

#### Undeploy `cert-manager`
To undeploy `cert-manager` from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy-cert-manager
```

### Deploy koor-operator with OLM
1. Make sure you have the `operator-sdk` binary [installed](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/), then install [OLM](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/olm-integration/tutorial-bundle/#enabling-olm):

```sh
operator-sdk olm install
```

2. Build and push your image to the registry. If `IMG` is not specified, it defaults to `$(REGISTRY_HOST)/koor-operator:v$(VERSION)`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push
```

3. Bundle the operator, then build and push the bundle image:

```sh
make bundle bundle-build bundle-push
```

4. Run the bundle:

```sh
operator-sdk run bundle <some registry>/koor-operator-bundle:v0.0.1
```

For example, using a local registry, the command becomes:

```sh
operator-sdk run bundle localhost:5000/koor-operator-bundle:v0.0.1 --use-http
```

### Install using Helm
1. Build and push your image to the registry. If `IMG` is not specified, it defaults to `$(REGISTRY_HOST)/koor-operator:v$(VERSION)`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push
```

2. Install the helm chart to the cluster. Create a `values.yaml` file if necessary.

```sh
helm install koor-operator --namespace koor-operator --create-namespace charts/koor-operator
```

#### Uninstall helm chart
To undeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
helm uninstall koor-operator --namespace koor-operator
```

## Create the KoorCluster Custom Resource
When deploying the operator locally, as a deployment, or using the OLM, you need to create a KoorCluster custom resource. To do that, update the samples in `config/samples/...` to fit your needs, then create the Custom Resource:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/storage_v1alpha1_koorcluster.yaml
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the cluster reaches the desired state.

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
