# koor-operator
// TODO(user): Add simple overview of use/purpose

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Use a Local Docker Registry with Minikube
1. Create a local docker registry:
```sh
sudo docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --volume ~/.registry/storage:/var/lib/registry registry:2
```
2. Edit the `/etc/hosts` file on your development machine, adding the [hostname from minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/host-access/) `host.minikube.internal` on the same line as the entry for localhost.
3. Add the registry to insecure-registries in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`
```json
{
    "insecure-registries": [
        "localhost:5000"
    ]
}
```
3. Validate that the registry at `host.minikube.internal:5000` is reachable from your development machine.
```sh
$ curl host.minikube.internal:5000/v2/_catalog
{"repositories":[]}
```
4. Start your minikube cluster with the flag `--insecure-registry="host.minikube.internal:5000"`
4. Use `host.minikube.internal:5000` as `<some-registry>` in the commands below.

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/koor-operator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/koor-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
