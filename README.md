# koor-operator
An operator that installs Koor Storage Distro
## Description
This operator is equivalent to the following commands:

```sh
helm repo add koor-release https://charts.koor.tech/release
helm install --create-namespace --namespace koor-ceph koor-ceph koor-release/rook-ceph -f utils/operatorValues.yaml
helm install --create-namespace --namespace koor-ceph koor-ceph-cluster \
   --set operatorNamespace=koor-ceph koor-release/rook-ceph-cluster -f values-override.yaml
```

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Use a Local Docker Registry with Minikube
1. Enable the minikube [registry plugin](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/registry/#docker-on-macos):
```sh
minikube addons enable registry
```

2. Redirect port 5000 on docker to port 5000 on the minikube
```sh
sudo docker run -d -p 5000:5000 alpine/socat TCP-LISTEN:5000,reuseaddr,fork TCP:$(minikube ip):5000
```

3. Use `localhost:5000` as `<some-registry>` in the commands below.

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Install [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/) to enable webhooks:
```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.10.1/cert-manager.yaml
```

3. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/koor-operator:tag
```

4. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/koor-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster

### Test It Out
1. Generate certificates for local testing:

```sh
make generate-certs
```

2. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

3. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make generate-certs install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
